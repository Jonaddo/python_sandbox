# About
This repository presents different maths exercises using only Numpy and matplotlib for illustration.

# square_circle
We imagine that we are asked to draw random dots in the corner of a square.  
In addition, we have to draw a circle in this corner.  
Finally, we have to color the dots in 2 different colors depending if they are in or out of the circle.
