# About this repository
The goal of this repository is to have simple template at hand for different data analytics use cases. In other words, the repository could be seen as a toolbox, somewhere the visitor can just search for the template he needs, clone it and then adjust it to his/her use case. The repository is divided in folders per topics. Topics range from dashboards to machine learning through distributed computing.  
In order to always improve the quality of the repository, I would be happy to hear any of your questions or remarks.  

Have a cool day!

Cordialament,

Jo
